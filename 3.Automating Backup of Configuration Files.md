# Automating Backup of Configuration Files

## Question:
We need to ensure that configuration files located in the /etc directory are backed up daily.
How would you write a script that creates a compressed archive (tarball) of the /etc directory and saves it with a timestamp?

## Note:
A tarball is a compressed archive file created using the tar (tape archive) command in Unix-like operating systems.
It is commonly used to combine multiple files and directories into a single file, making backups and file transfers easier to manage.

## Answer:
This requirement can be fulfilled by creating a shell script that generates a backup of the /etc directory on a daily basis.
The script uses the tar command to compress the directory into a single archive file and appends a timestamp to the filename to uniquely identify each backup.
Storing backups with timestamps helps in maintaining versioned backups and allows easy restoration of configuration files from a specific date if needed.
