# Checking and Restarting a Service

## Question:
Our web server service occasionally stops unexpectedly. We need a script that checks whether the service is running and automatically restarts it if it is not.
How would you approach this?

## Answer:
This can be handled by writing a shell script that periodically checks the status of the web server service.
The script uses system service management commands such as systemctl or service to verify whether the service is active.
If the service is found to be stopped or inactive, the script automatically restarts it.
This ensures high availability of the web server and minimizes downtime without requiring manual intervention.
