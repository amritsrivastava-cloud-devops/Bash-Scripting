# Parsing and Summarizing Log Files
## Question:
We need a script that parses web server log files and summarizes the number of requests coming from each IP address. How would you write a script to achieve this?

## Answer:
This can be accomplished by using text-processing tools such as awk to read and analyze web server log files.
The script extracts IP addresses from each log entry, counts how many times each IP appears, and then summarizes the total number of requests per IP address.
This approach is commonly used to analyze traffic patterns and identify high-usage or suspicious IP addresses.
