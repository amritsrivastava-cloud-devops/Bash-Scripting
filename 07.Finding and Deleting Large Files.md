# Finding and Deleting Large Files

## Question:
Our server’s disk space is being consumed by large, old files. We need a script that finds and deletes files larger than one gigabyte and older than thirty days. How would you write this?

## Answer:
This can be achieved by using the find command in a shell script. The script searches for files that exceed a specified size and age, then removes them automatically.
This helps free up disk space and keeps the system clean without requiring manual file inspection.
