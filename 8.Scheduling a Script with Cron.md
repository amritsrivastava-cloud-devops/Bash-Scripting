# Scheduling a Script with Cron

## Question:
We have a shell script that needs to run every day at midnight. How would you schedule this using cron?

## Answer:

By editing the user’s crontab file and defining the appropriate time and script path, the script will execute automatically at the specified interval.
This is a reliable way to automate recurring system tasks.
