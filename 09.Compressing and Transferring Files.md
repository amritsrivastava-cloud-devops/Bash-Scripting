# Compressing and Transferring Files

## Question:
We need to compress a directory and transfer it to a remote server every day. Can you write a script to automate this process?

## Answer:
This process can be automated using a shell script that first compresses the directory into an archive using the tar command.
The compressed file is then transferred to a remote server using secure copy tools such as scp.
Automating this workflow ensures regular data transfers and reduces manual effort.
