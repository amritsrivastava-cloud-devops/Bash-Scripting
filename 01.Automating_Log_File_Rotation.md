# Automating Log File Rotation
## Question:
In our system, large log files are generated every day. Manually rotating these log files is both time-consuming and prone to errors. Can you write a shell script to automate log rotation so that log files older than seven days are archived and then deleted?

## Answer:
Log rotation can be automated by using a shell script that identifies log files older than seven days, archives them for backup purposes, and then removes them from the system. This approach helps save disk space, reduces manual effort, and ensures log management is handled consistently.
