# Automating Database Backup

## Question:
We require daily backups of our MySQL database. Can you provide a shell-based approach to automate this process?

## Answer:
Daily MySQL database backups can be automated by writing a shell script that uses the mysqldump utility.
The script creates a dump of the database, stores it in a backup directory, and typically appends a timestamp to the filename.
Automating this process ensures data safety, simplifies recovery, and reduces the risk of data loss.
